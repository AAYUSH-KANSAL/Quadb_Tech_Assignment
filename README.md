# Simple Blockchain Implementation in Python

This is a basic blockchain implementation in Python. It creates a simple chain of blocks, each containing a reference to the previous block, some data, a timestamp, and a unique hash.

## Features
- Generates a **genesis block** as the first block in the chain.
- Uses **SHA-256 double hashing** for security.
- Automatically adds new blocks to the chain.
- Each block stores:
  - Previous block's hash
  - Data
  - Timestamp
  - Its own unique hash

## How It Works
1. The first block (**Genesis Block**) is created manually.
2. New blocks are added to the chain with a reference to the previous blockâ€™s hash.
3. Each block's hash is calculated based on its data, timestamp, and previous hash.
4. The blockchain structure ensures data integrity since modifying any block would invalidate all subsequent blocks.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or copy the script.
2. Run the script using:

   python blockchain.py
The program will generate 10 new blocks and print their details.
